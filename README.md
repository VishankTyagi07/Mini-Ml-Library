# MINI ML LIBRARY

Mini ML Library is a Python-based project that provides clean, modular, and educational implementations of core machine learning algorithms from scratch.  
The project is structured to clearly separate **classification** and **regression** techniques, emphasizing algorithmic understanding rather than black-box usage.

## Project Overview

Machine Learning libraries such as scikit-learn abstract away much of the internal logic behind popular algorithms.  
This repository focuses on implementing these algorithms manually to gain a deeper understanding of:

- Mathematical foundations of ML models
- Training and prediction workflows
- Model evaluation and behavior
- Clean and maintainable ML code structure

This project demonstrates strong fundamentals in **machine learning**, **Python programming**, and **algorithmic thinking**.
